      <p>I’m Holly Landrum-Mullen, a Purdue University Graduate. I have been in Residential Design and Construction since 1986.
        I started my career doing drafting work for a local residential designer before being hired by one of the nation’s leading
        production builders to design their plans for them. In 1996, I decided to step out and start my own business,
        “h.r. design”.</p>
      <p>Ever since I was a little girl, I have had a passion for architecture. I love the challenge of creating a plan that fits
        the individual needs of my client. I listen to their wants and needs when putting together a house plan that fits their
        lifestyle while keeping their budget in mind.</p>
      <p>I start the process with a free consultation to discuss wants, desires, and needs. From there, I put together a set of
        preliminary plans that gives the client a floor plan with basic room dimensions and a front elevation of the house. With my
        Autocad program, the client can also see their plan in 3-D. Once the preliminaries are “nailed” down, I go to construction plans.
        These give the builder what they need for the construction process.</p>
